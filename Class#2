I learned about Codesters and how to make an animated stage with sprites, backgrounds, actions, etc.
Next time I'm here, I would like to learn a little more about how to code apps and games.
Next time I'm here, my goals are to try memorizing different bits & pieces of code, so I don't have to keep looking at how to do what. Another one of my goals is to make a game that might teach little kids about, perhaps, kindness, safety, or some essential life skill. My final goal I will list today is to make (perhaps) another game that is meant to increase accuracy skills with hitting something. Not very specific, though.
